# Baggage HTTP Header Format

The `baggage` header is a list of unordered key-value pairs with associated metadata.
Multiple `baggage` headers are allowed.
Multiple `baggage` headers MAY be combined in a single header according to [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-24).

## Header Name

Header name: `baggage`

In order to increase interoperability across multiple protocols and encourage successful integration,
implementations SHOULD keep the header name lowercase.

## Header Content

This section uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of [[!RFC5234]].

### Definition

```ABNF
baggage-string         =  list-member 0*179( OWS "," OWS list-member )
list-member            =  key OWS "=" OWS value *( OWS ";" OWS property )
property               =  key OWS "=" OWS value
property               =/ key OWS
key                    =  token ; as defined in RFC 2616, Section 2.2
value                  =  *baggage-octet
baggage-octet          =  %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
                          ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,
                          ; whitespace, DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,
                          ; and backslash
OWS                    =  *( SP / HTAB ) ; optional white space, as defined in RFC 7230, Section 3.2.3
```

`token` is defined in [[!RFC2616]], Section 2.2: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2

The definition of `OWS` is taken from [[RFC7230]], Section 3.2.3: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.3

#### baggage-string

List of `list-member`s with optional properties attached.
Uniqueness of keys between multiple `list-member`s in a `baggage-string` is not guaranteed.
The order of duplicate entries SHOULD be preserved when mutating the list.
Producers SHOULD try to produce a `baggage-string` without any `list-member`s which duplicate the `key` of another list member.

#### key

ASCII string according to the `token` format, defined in [RFC2616, Section 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2).
Leading and trailing whitespaces (`OWS`) are allowed but MUST be trimmed when converting the header into a data structure.

#### value

A value contains a URL encoded UTF-8 string.
Leading and trailing whitespaces (`OWS`) are allowed but MUST be trimmed when converting the header into a data structure.

Note, `value` MAY contain any number of the equal sign (`=`) characters. Parsers
MUST NOT assume that the equal sign is only used to separate `key` and `value`.

#### property

Additional metadata MAY be appended to values in the form of property set, represented as semi-colon `;` delimited list of keys and/or key-value pairs, e.g. `;k1=v1;k2;k3=v3`. The semantic of such properties is <a>opaque</a> to this specification.
Leading and trailing `OWS` is allowed but MUST be trimmed when converting the header into a data structure.

### Limits

1. Maximum number of `list-member`s: `180`.
2. Maximum number of bytes per `list-member`: `4096`.
3. Maximum number of bytes per `baggage-string`: `8192`.

### Example

The following example header contains 3 `list-member`s.
The `baggage-string` contained in the header contains 86 bytes.
82 bytes come from the `list-member`s and 4 bytes come from commas and optional whitespace.

```
baggage: key1=value1;property1;property2, key2 = value2, key3=value3; propertyKey=propertyValue
```

- `key1=value1;property1;property2`
  - 31 bytes
- `key2 = value2`
  - 13 bytes
- `key3=value3; propertyKey=propertyValue`
  - 38 bytes

## Examples of HTTP headers

Single header:

```
baggage: userId=alice,serverNode=DF:28,isProduction=false
```

Context might be split into multiple headers:

```
baggage: userId=alice
baggage: serverNode=DF%3A28,isProduction=false
```

Values and names might begin and end with spaces:

```
baggage: userId =   alice
baggage: serverNode = DF%3A28, isProduction = false
```

### Example use case

For example, if all of your data needs to be sent to a single node, you could propagate a property indicating that.

```
baggage: serverNode=DF:28
```

For example, if you need to annotate logs with some request-specific information, you could propagate a property using the baggage header.

```
baggage: userId=alice
```

For example, if you have non-production requests that flow through the same services as production requests.

```
baggage: isProduction=false
```
# Mutating baggage
A system receiving a `baggage` request header SHOULD send it to outgoing requests.
A system MAY mutate the value of this header before passing it on.

Because baggage entry keys, values, and metadata are not specified here, producers and consumers MAY agree on any set of mutation rules that don't violate the specification. For example, keys may be deduplicated by keeping the first entry, keeping the last entry, or concatenating values together.

The following mutations are allowed:

* **Add a new key/value pair.** A key/value pair MAY be added.
* **Update an existing value.** The value for any given key MAY be updated.
* **Delete a key/value pair.** Any key/value pair MAY be deleted.
* **Deduplicating the list.** Duplicate keys MAY be removed.
